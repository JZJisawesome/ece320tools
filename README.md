# ece320tools

"This guy's doing *another* autograder?"

Yep, along with Nick Chan! :)

We didn't make this earlier on in the term because, until now, the golden traces we've been provided have been adequate for testing.

However, especially with PD4 and beyond, dealing with don't care values in the traces can be a bit painful. That's where ece320tools comes in!

ece320tools are in part based off of [IRVE](https://github.com/angry-goose-initiative/irve), the first part of our Linux-capable RISC-V emulator and CPU implementation project. If you're interested in learning more about it, [check out our Github organization here!](https://github.com/angry-goose-initiative)

Whelp hope this helps people out!
